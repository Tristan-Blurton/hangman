# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.
This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

## Objective
The objective of this project is to consolidate the skills and knowledge acquired during the preceding lessons of the AICore professional certification.

## Learning Points
Significant learning points are the practical application of OOP and github as well as further reinforcement of basic pythonic coding principles.

## Usage
The game takes places within the console. Simply run milestone_5.py and enjoy! The game comes pre-loaded with five fruits - the list at the top of milestone_5.py can be edited with whichever words you desire - one of these will be randomly selected and you must guess the letters! 

## File Structure
The hangman file contains milestone files for each step of the project. Only milestone 4 and 5 are required to play the game.

## Licensing
No License - do with it what you will!
